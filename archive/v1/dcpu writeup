DCPU-16 Toolkit

A collection of tools for DCPU-16 development.  Includes an assembler, linker, and emulator.

(Keeping with the low level theme / Following a low level theme)
The tools are written in C and use the Win32 API.  Demo programs are written in DCPU-16 assembly.

The DCPU-16 is a fictional 16 bit processor designed by Markus Persson.  The specification defines the DCPU-16 to have 64K words of RAM, a 100kHz clock speed, 12 registers, and 36 opcodes.  There are also several pieces of hardware the DCPU can interact with, the LEM1802 monitor, Generic Keyboard, and Generic Clock.  Writing DCPU assembly gives the same rewarding feeling as x86 or 6502, but alleviates much of the ___.  It is gameified assembly programming.  The simplicity of the DCPU made it the ideal target for a toy toolkit.
